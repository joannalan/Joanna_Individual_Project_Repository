## Abstract

This research project explores user responses and reviews on YouTube related to Chinese dramas in English-speaking countries. With the increasing popularity of East Asian popular culture, YouTube has become a platform for sharing and discussing cross-cultural content, including Chinese television dramas (C-dramas). While previous studies have focused on viewers' reactions to Western content on YouTube, the responses to non-Western content, particularly C-dramas, remain understudied. By analyzing user-generated content from four selected C-dramas, this project aims to gain insights into how English-speaking audiences perceive and react to Chinese dramas on YouTube. The findings will contribute to our understanding of the impact of YouTube on global cultural flows and provide practical methodologies for analyzing user feedback for content development and marketing strategies.
